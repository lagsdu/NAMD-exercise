    <h1>Supplemental Information on running NAMD exercise on local machines</h1>
    <p>
        On this webpage, the required information for running the exercise described in
        "A Computer Laboratory for the Calculation of the Heat Capacity of a Peptide Unfolding Transition" will be on
        the local machines without the use of the VIKING platform.

    <h2 id="getting_namd">Getting NAMD</h2>
    <p>
        NAMD can be downloaded for free from <a
            href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=NAMD" target="_blank">here</a>.
        However, a free account is required.
        A different version of NAMD must be used, depending on the operating system of the machine being used to run the
        simulation.
        Below are our recommendations for which versions to download for running the described exercise (as of writing).
    </p>
    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>
        For machines running Windows, we recommend downloading the "Win64" binaries under "Version 2.14" from the NAMD
        Download page,
        or by clicking <a
            href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?UserID=&AccessCode=&ArchiveID=1573"
            target="_black">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The binaries will come compressed in a ZIP archive, which must be extracted.
        We recommend creating a new folder for this exercise, and extracting all the NAMD files into the folder.
    </p>
    <h3>macOS</h3>
    <p>
        For machines running macOS, we recommend downloading the "MacOSX-x86_64" binaries under "Version 2.14" from the
        NAMD Download page,
        or by clicking <a
            href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?UserID=&AccessCode=&ArchiveID=1628"
            target="_black">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although these binaries have been compiled for the x86-64 instruction set. They should run out of the box on
        macOS machines with M1, and M2 chips, using the Rosetta 2 translation layer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The binaries will come compressed in a tar gzip archive, which must be extracted.
        We recommend creating a new folder for this exercise, and extracting all the NAMD files into the folder.
    </p>
    <h3>Linux</h3>
    <p>
        For machines running Linux, we recommend downloading the "Linux-x86_64-multicore" binaries under "Version 3.0b3"
        from the NAMD Download page,
        or by clicking <a
            href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?UserID=&AccessCode=&ArchiveID=1669"
            target="_black">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        These binaries should run on any major up to date Linux machine. If an older Linux distribution is used, the
        newest binaries may not run.
        In this case, it may be possible to use an older version of NAMD.
    </p>
    <p>
        The binaries will come compressed in a tar gzip archive, which must be extracted.
        We recommend creating a new folder for this exercise, and extracting all the NAMD files into the folder.

        The files required for running the simulation exercise can be downloaded <a href="simulation.zip"
            target="_blank">here</a>.
        We recommend extracting the "simulation" folder into the same folder as the NAMD binary, such that the the
        folder structure is as follows (here shown for Linux):

    <p>
        The download includes various topology files, an input parameter file for the force field as well as two
        configuration files for the 2 stages
        of the simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before running the simulation, the temperature of the simulation must be set. This must be done for both stages.
        To do this, go into the "simulation" folder, then into the "stage3" folder, and open the file named
        "namd_stage3_1.conf" with a text editor.
        On the 10th line of this file it should say "set temperature &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &lt;INSERT TEMPERATURE HERE&gt;",
        here "&lt;INSERT TEMPERATURE HERE&gt"; should be replaced with the temperature. The same should be done for the
        file named "namd_stage4_1.conf"
        in the "stage4" folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also possible to change how long the simulations run for by editing the second to last line,
        which says something along the lines of "set num_steps [ expr 10000000 - $currenttimestep ]" here, one can
        simply change the number.
        Note that the number of simulation steps taken in the first stage will also be counted as steps in the second
        stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following, a way for running NAMD with the simulation files for Windows, macOS and Linux is described.
    </p>
    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>
        To start the first stage of the simulation, open the Command Prompt in the Exercise folder,
        where the simulation folder and the NAMD binary is located, and run the following command. In which &lt;CORE
        COUNT&gt;
        should be replaced by the amount of CPU cores to use for the simulation. For this simulation we recommend using
        between 4 and 8 cores:
    </p>
    <p>
        namd2.exe simulation/stage3/namd_stage3_1.conf +ppn &lt;CORE COUNT&gt; &gt;
        simulation/stage3/__stage3_1_namd_stdout.log 2&gt; simulation/stage3/__stage3_1_namd_stderr.log
    </p>
    <p>
        Running this command will create two files containing the various outputs from the simulation,
        as well as any errors encountered during the simulation. When the first stage of the simulation is done running,
        the second stage can be started by running the following command:
    </p>
    <p>
        namd2.exe simulation/stage4/namd_stage4_1.conf +ppn &lt;CORE COUNT&gt; &gt;
        simulation/stage4/__stage4_1_namd_stdout.log 2&gt; simulation/stage4/__stage4_1_namd_stderr.log
    </p>
    <h3>macOS</h3>
    <p>
        To start the simulation on a macOS machine, one might first have to make the binary executable. This can be done by navigating to
        the exercise folder and running the following command in the terminal:
    </p>
    <p>
        chmod 755 namd3
    </p>
    <p>
        The first stage of the simulation can now be started by running the following command in the terminal, Here
        &lt;CORE COUNT&gt;
        should be replaced by the amount of CPU cores to use for the simulation. For this simulation we recommend using
        between 4 and 8 cores:
    </p>
    <p>
        ./namd2 simulation/stage3/namd_stage3_1.conf +ppn &lt;CORE COUNT&gt; &gt;
        simulation/stage3/__stage3_1_namd_stdout.log 2&gt; simulation/stage3/__stage3_1_namd_stderr.log
    </p>
    <p>
        Running this command will create two files containing the various outputs from the simulation,
        as well as any errors encountered during the simulation. When the first stage of the simulation is done running,
        the second stage can be started by running the following command:
    </p>
    <p>
        ./namd2 simulation/stage4/namd_stage4_1.conf +ppn &lt;CORE COUNT&gt; &gt;
        simulation/stage4/__stage4_1_namd_stdout.log 2&gt; simulation/stage4/__stage4_1_namd_stderr.log
    </p>
    <h3>Linux</h3>
    <p>
        To start the simulation on a Linux machine, one might first have to make the binary executable. This can be done by navigating to
        the exercise folder and running the following command in the terminal:
    </p>
    <p>
        chmod 755 namd2
    </p>
    <p>
        The first stage of the simulation can now be started by running the following command in the terminal, Here
        &lt;CORE COUNT&gt;
        should be replaced by the amount of CPU cores to use for the simulation. For this simulation we recommend using
        between 4 and 8 cores:
    </p>
    <p>
        ./namd3 simulation/stage3/namd_stage3_1.conf +ppn &lt;CORE COUNT&gt; &gt;
        simulation/stage3/__stage3_1_namd_stdout.log 2&gt; simulation/stage3/__stage3_1_namd_stderr.log
    </p>
    <p>
        Running this command will create two files containing the various outputs from the simulation,
        as well as any errors encountered during the simulation. When the first stage of the simulation is done running,
        the second stage can be started by running the following command:
    </p>
    <p>
        ./namd3 simulation/stage4/namd_stage4_1.conf +ppn &lt;CORE COUNT&gt; &gt;
        simulation/stage4/__stage4_1_namd_stdout.log 2&gt; simulation/stage4/__stage4_1_namd_stderr.log
